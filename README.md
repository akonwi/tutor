Language studying app built with node.js on node-webkit

This was originally a ruby app built with shoes4 for studying vocab in french but the shoes DSL is still a work in progress with issues I'm tired of fighting against s I'm attempting to convert it into a javascript/HTML5 app

## Usage

(This runs as a desktop app in [node-webkit](http:github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit))

First, download and install the pre-built binaries. Then zip the contents into a node-webkit executable using `zip -r app.nw *`. And then use the 'node-webkit' script from downloaded binaries to run app.nw with `/path/to/node-webkit app.nw`. There are more details in the wiki of the project.
